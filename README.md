# RetailCalendars



## Installation

This gem implements 4-4-5 / 4-5-4 / 5-4-4 retail calendar in a very lightweight manner.

While several similar gems that do this exist (most notably the gem retail_calendar, not to be confused with this gem: retail_calendars), I couldn't find one that supports all forms 445, 454, 544 and that doesn't have serious issues and stale pull requests.

The calendar starts on Sunday and ends on Saturday.

IMPORTANT: when installing, make sure you type the gem's name '**retail_calendars**' and not retail_calendar

```ruby
gem 'retail_calendars'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install retail_calendars

## Usage

    calendar = RetailCalendar::Calendar.new(type: 445)
    
    puts calendar.start_of_year(2020) # 2020-02-02
    puts calendar.start_of_year_by_date(Date.today) # 2020-02-02
    puts calendar.end_of_year(2020) # 2021-01-30
    puts calendar.start_of_month(2020, 1) # 2020-02-02
    puts calendar.end_of_month(2020, 1) # 2020-02-29
    puts calendar.weeks_in_year(2020) # 52
    puts calendar.retail_week_to_date(2, 2020) # {:start_week=>Sun, 09 Feb 2020, :end_week=>Sat, 15 Feb 2020}
    
## TODOS
Support different year start day and month.
